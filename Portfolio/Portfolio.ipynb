    "# Relational Database Building\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A **relational database** is defined as *a collection of tables based on relational data model.*  All relational database use SQL(Structured Query Language) to query and get the data. In relational database, tables are the basic element, which make up of rows and columns. In order to build a relational database, you need to create tables and decide their relationship. A relational database works via storing information in tables, where each table has its own rows and columns. A row describes a _record_ , while a column describes a _field_ . The following is a example of original table.\n",

    "## 2. Data collection\n",
    "At first, you need to collect your data to create tables. For data collection, you can use [Python](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKzZEtxIX14) to crawl data. Also, If you need more turtorial in data collection using python, you can click [This](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/python-developer). After data gather, you need to determine fields and create tables for using in relational database. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Modeling & Preliminary Design\n",
    "before you start a relational database design, you need to analyse you demand about the databse and draw the entity-relationship diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define Purpose & Divide Tables\n",
    "You need determine what information you need to record into the database. From here, you need divide your tables into individual tables. Determine what the columns (fields) of each table will be and do not repeat information. For example, In my original table, it can be divided into two table, one is games which just game, one is game features which record games attribute, and setting primary key to link them.\n",

    "### Relation Analysis\n",
    "Relation analysis asks you to analyze your requirement clearly. A relational database design must figure out  what your entities, attributes and relationships are. \n",
    "#### entities: represents the objects in the real-world. For example, a game, a gamer both are entities.\n",
    "#### attribute: the characteristic of object or things have. For example, a game should have price, releasedate, publisher, developer and so on. all these information is its attribute. \n",
    "#### relationship:the connection between two entities. In your design you should determin the relationship between you tables.\n",
    "* \tOne to one relationship: In a one-to-one relationship, only one row of a table is linked to at most one row on the other table. For example, a game list item can only map to a game features  details table that provides more information on the item. Below is a instance. Both tables can be joined with common column ID of them, which are the primary key of both tables. One called ID, another called ResponseID.\n",

For example, assuming a game can have many users and every user  has more than one game. Below is an instance to relate it.\n",

    "### Entity-Relationship Diagram Building\n",
    "A E-R diagram is used to represent the entities, their attributes and the relationship between the entities through a graph. In my example, the relationship between tables are one to one and one to many. the entities includes games, gamers, game reviews, game companys. Through creating E-R Diagram, you can know structure and relationship of your data clearly. you should describe entities, entities' attribute and the relationship between entities clearly. This [link](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams) may be helpful to your study.\n",

    "## 4. Physical Design & Implement\n",
    "After building E-R diagram, we need to normalize our table to meet the criteria of database. **Normalization** means use some way to handle tables to make it meet the standard of database to reduce redundancy. In order to get a ideal table to load into database, you need apply the first normal form, second normal form and third normal form.\n",
